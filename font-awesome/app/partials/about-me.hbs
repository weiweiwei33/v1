Born in California, raised in Shanghai, Weiwei is a Taiwanese who is now studying Interaction Design at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, California.

Previously, as the first designer to join co-working space and accelerator XNode in China, her focus was on internal and external vision communication through delivering weekly design digests to the team, produced creative promotional materials for external use and wrote articles for their publication.

She’s also an alumnus and founding member of John Bielenberg’s experimental education program Secret Project, where she explores pathways to inspire and support individuals through the process of Thinking Wrong by working with progressive schools in San Francisco and Taiwan.

Weiwei explores the relationship between humans and the environment. She desires to decipher what it means to coexist with the environment she is in. She works in the medium that’s most appropriate for the goal and applies fundamental theories on communication to a host of challenging and important entangled messes - such as climate change and education system - without fear, favor, or jargon.
