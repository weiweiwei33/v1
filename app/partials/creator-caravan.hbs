##Introduction
Creator Caravan is a service that curates informative and educational tour experiences for global nomads. From arrival to departure, your trip is curated, safe and enjoyable.
##Focus
Just like any language, speaking in visual language smoothly takes practices and encapsulating a companyâ€™s mission and disposition requires resonation. / Building a cohesive language for three touch-points that will exist in different cultural and historical background was required me to improve my eye for freshness, adaptability, and flexibility.
##Approach
TBD see documentation
##Next
Creating a conceptual and visual thread to unify touch points while maintaining an identity and a sense of uniqueness was the checklist that I always went back to. Since this project, there has been a realization toward exploring a much greater breathe of tools, specifically in those that can assisting in scaling.
