        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>It is very easy to turn toward the devices we carry at many different kinds of social environments. Having an alibi to initiate a conversation can often make the process simple.</p>
        <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>Understand effective ways to encourage simple social interactions. Prototype a proof of concept with accessible materials and tools such as laser cutting and photon.</p>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>see documentation</p>

        <h2>First thing first</h2>
        <p>Content synthesis from interviews with two Industrial Design then-juniors. With very specific habits of avoiding social interactions, we wanted to increase the possibility of them interacting with classmates in school.</p>

        <h2>Narrowing the idea</h2>
        <p>We decided to make a simple game that is internet connected. Each player can invite anyone to play a 30 second button mashing game, and if the winner is the owner of the game, a text message would be sent to his or her partner informing the winning
            and encouraging the partner not to even try to win.</p>

        <h2>Prototyping </h2>
        <p>Modeling the game. | Laying out the electronics and the container for them. | Testing the electronics. </p>

        <h2>Assembling </h2>
        <p>Assembling components together.</p>

        <h1>Next</h1>
        <p>The element of play can certainly dial up the joy in the world. This project definitely shed light on the possibility to weave play into different types of interfacing both offline and online.</p>
