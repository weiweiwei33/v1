        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>It is very easy to turn toward the devices we carry at many different kinds of social environments. Having an alibi to initiate a conversation can often make the process simple.</p>
        <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>Understand effective ways to encourage simple social interactions. Prototype a proof of concept with accessible materials and tools such as laser cutting and photon.</p>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>see documentation</p>

        <p><b>First things first</b></p>
        <p>Content synthesis from interviews with two Industrial Design third-years. Because they have very specific habits of avoiding social interactions besides interactions with each other, we wanted to increase the possibility of them interacting with classmates in school.</p>

        <p><b>Narrowing the idea</b></p>
        <p>We decided to make a simple game that is Internet-connected. Each player can invite anyone to play a 30-second button-smashing game and, if the winner is the owner of the game, a text message will be sent to his or her partner, informing them of the win and encouraging the partner to not even try to win.</p>

        <p><b>Prototyping</b></p>
        <p>Modeling the game. | Laying out the electronics and the container for them. | Testing the electronics. </p>

        <h1>Next</h1>
        <p>The element of play can certainly dial up the joy in the world. This project definitely shed light on the possibility to weave play into different types of interfacing both offline and online.</p>
