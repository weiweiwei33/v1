        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>When we decided to curate experiences that audiences of different kinds wouldn’t have in other ways, we made some clear decisions about the content we create and include.
            <ul>
                <li>Living things had to disappear to create an environment for solitary thinking.</li>
                <li>Both light and scale would play an important role in enabling different types of feelings. </li>
                <li>Skewing the gravity in this world is one way to blend reality and virtual reality together.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>TBD</p>
        <br>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>Moving upward on a ladder from abstraction to a familiar environment by engaging the act of “level design” in game design terms to create architectural spaces for interaction.</p>

        <p>
            We explored how video game engines can influence the perception and communication of spatial environments, and cultivate different sources of inspiration. / This study also has implications toward the powerfulness of live rendering and of providing different
            flavors of inspirations which are exciting areas to explore.
