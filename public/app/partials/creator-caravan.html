        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Creator Caravan is a service that curates informative and educational tour experiences for global nomads. From arrival to departure your trip is curated, safe, and enjoyable.</p>
        <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>Just as in any language, speaking smoothly in visual language takes practice, and encapsulating a companyâ€™s mission and disposition requires resonation. Building a cohesive language for three touch-points that will exist in different cultural and historical backgrounds required me to improve my eye for freshness, adaptability, and flexibility.</p>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>Creating a logo that conveys the liveness of traveling while maintaining a cute, but not childish quality.</p>

        <p>Creating a conceptual and visual thread to unify touch points while maintaining an identity and a sense of uniqueness" was the standard that I continuously checked against my progress. Since this project, I have had a realization of the importance of scaling, and have thus moved toward exploring a much greater breadth of tools, specifically in those that can assisting in scaling.  </p>
