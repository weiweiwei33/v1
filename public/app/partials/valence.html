        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            No matter where we live, we are all likely to have a poor understanding of how we create pollution footprint. There isn’t a energy label on the products we purchase, we don’t see the change in price of electricity like we do at stock market. / While all
            of the products we use are energy dependent, we are not leveraging technology to create an efficient energy network. In a team of three, we reimagined the way we consume, store, and distribute energy.
        </p>
        <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>As a sponsored project, we looked at how Ford might elegantly transition to an auto and mobility company by mitigating the impact of its energy dependent products and increasing private clean energy solutions in the city of San Francisco.
        </p>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>Synthesizing secondary research materials mainly from Saul Griffith, Bret Victor, and David Mackey, we understood that: -As individuals, we must budget our lifestyle to only consume 12,000 watt per year. - To fully transition into a renewable
            energy era, the storage of electricity is what’s missing from current energy infrastructure. valence-1 Our (current) path to 6°C warming. valence-2 Our (preferred) path for 2°C warming. valence-3 Actual and required battery growth rates. As
            one may have noticed, the current battery growth rate is not looking optimistic at all. | What if, cars’ batteries become part of the battery storage network? It is very plausible to design and manufacture smart batteries that can be trading
            in and out electricity for storage and usage depending on the current electricity rate. See this page for all research links on future trends for cars and city formations, energy consumption, and software infrastructure. See this page to view
            synthesized research on all topics.

        <h1>Next</h1>

        <p>A quick dive into energy generation, distribution, and consumption is a great way to expose myself in an area. To move forward, devoting more attention toward understanding the details of the extensive energy network will equip me to make relevant
            contribution.
