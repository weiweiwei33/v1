        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            In day to day life, we do not communicate information about the energy systems we are apart of. No matter where we live, we are all likely to have a poor understanding of how we create pollution footprint; there isn’t a nutrition label for energy on the
            products we purchase, there isn't a stock ticker for the price of electricity. While all of the products we use are energy dependent, we are not leveraging technology to create an efficient energy network. In a team of three, we reimagined
            the way we consume, store, and distribute energy.
        </p>


        <!-- <h1>Focus</h1>
        <p>As a sponsored project, we looked at how Ford might elegantly mitigate the impact of its energy dependent products and increasing private clean energy solutions in the city of San Francisco.
        </p> -->

        <br><br>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>Synthesizing secondary research materials mainly from Saul Griffith, Bret Victor, and David Mackey, we understood that:
            <ul>
                <li> As individuals, we must budget our lifestyle to only consume 12,000 watt per year.</li>
                <br>
                <li> In order to fully traisition into a renewable energy era, we have to optimize the infrastructure for energy storage. </li>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p><b>Discover</b></p>

        <p>Conducting secondary research materials mainly from <a href="http://www.saulgriffith.com">Saul Griffith</a>, <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret Victor</a>, and <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/">David Mackey</a>, we understood
            that as individuals, we must budget our lifestyle to only consume 12,000 watt per year. In addition to that, currently, the storage of electricity is what’s missing from current energy infrastructure.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p><b>Determine</b></p>

        <p>As one may have noticed, the current battery growth rate is not looking optimistic at all. What if, cars’ batteries become part of the battery storage network? It is very plausible to design and manufacture smart batteries that can trade stored
            energy based on the current price of electricity. <br> See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1chyCJwS7KpTAU1dIa-_nLkX4D3KcNDZ6Agy7n6qKRoU/edit?pli=1#gid=811916405">page</a> for all research links on future trends for cars
            and city formations, energy consumption, and software infrastructure. See this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yuj3pdes7sgrh7g/Updated%20Ford%20Auto%20Upfront%20Prez.pdf?dl=0">page</a> to view synthesized research on all topics. </p>

        <br>
        <p><b>Define</b></p>
        <p>To understand how energy is distributed and what the potential impact would be of our solution, we mapped the current energy network. Eventually, we created a simple animated system diagram to explain how our proposal would optimize the existing
            network.</p>

        <br>
        <p><b>Delivery</b></p>

        <p>Through leveraging the portability of smarter car batteries, the final proposal of this project was to relieve energy grid strain. By using the sharing economy to transport and store energy, it also intend to leverage the embedded energy of cars
            to a greater degree. </p>

        <h1>Next</h1>

        <p>A quick dive into energy generation, distribution, and consumption is a great way to expose myself in an area. To move forward, devoting more attention toward understanding the details of the extensive energy network will equip me to make relevant
            contribution.
